Sealed classes, introduced in Java,
 provide a mechanism to restrict the 
 inheritance hierarchy of a class or interface.
  This means that a sealed class or interface can only be
  
   extended or implemented by a predefined, specific set of classes or interfaces.
    This feature enhances type safety and allows for exhaustive pattern matching with switch expressions. 
Key Concepts:

sealed keyword: Used to declare a class
 or interface as sealed.
permits keyword: Used after the se
aled class or interface declaration to spec
ify the direct subclasses or implementing classes that are allowed.
Permitted Subclasses/Implementors: T
hese classes must be declared as either final, sealed, or non-sealed.
final: The subclass cannot be exten
ded further.
sealed: The subclass can be exten
ded, but only by a specified se
t of classes. 
non-sealed: The subclass can b

e extended without restrictions, effectively ending the sealed hierarchy at that point.
